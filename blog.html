              The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the
              data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the
              browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.

              We often identify those scopes as local scopes and identify the top-level scope as the global scope. In a
              browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node.js, it’s controlled
              by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the
              like. You can also use them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not to be confused with
              empty object literals.

              The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
              empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
              effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

              Undefined is a special JavaScript value and also a data type. JavaScript also has a global variable with
              the name undefined which has the value Undefined. It is one of JavaScript’s primitive values and is
              treated as falsy for boolean operations.We can get differen types of undefined such as :Uninitialized
              variable, Function argument that has not been supplied, The return value of functions that don’t return a
              value, Non-existing object Property, Non-existing array elements, void operator, Explicitly set to
              undefined.

              <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse
              plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
              appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom
              CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
              <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
